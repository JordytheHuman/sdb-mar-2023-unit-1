# HTML

- HTML Document has a series of tags that we call elements
- Most elements have an open and closing tags 
 -There are a few elements that are considered self closing

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
The HTML tags tells the browser this is the root of the file


```html
<html lang="en"></html>
```
Title element tells the browser to display what is in between the tags in the tab or browser window.

```html
<body>    
</body>
```

The body element is a container that will be used for displaying all the visible content to the browser [`what you want to be seen`]


Comments 
<!-- About me -->
 use the command: 
windows: `ctrl + /`
mac: `command + /`
if you want to make a comment. You DO NOT have to select the entire row if you want to comment it. Only highlight if you want to select multiply lines of code


## VS Code Shortcuts
- `! + tab` gives us a boiler plate code (bang tab)

`alt +arrows (up or down)` wil take what you highlighted and move it up or down.
