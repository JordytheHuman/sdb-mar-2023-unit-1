# Terminal Notes

To see what directory we are currently in use the following command: `pwd`

To get a list of files and folders that are in the current directory use the following command: `ls`

To change to a new directory use the following command: `cd [name of folder (caps matter)]`

To move back a directory (folder) use the following command: `cd ..`

To create a folder use the following command: `mkdir [name of folder]`

To see hidden files in a directory use the following command: `ls -a`

That is his `hint` to us

if you know the directory that you want to jump to, use `cd ~ [full name and chain of directory]`
